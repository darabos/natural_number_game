# Advanced Addition World

## Level 13: `ne_succ_self`

The last level in Advanced Addition World is the statement
that $n\not=\operatorname{succ}(n)$. When you've done this
you've completed Advanced Addition World and can move on
to Advanced Multiplication World (after first doing
Multiplication World, if you didn't do it already).
