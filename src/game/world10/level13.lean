# Inequality world. 

## Level 13: `not_succ_le_self`

Turns out that `¬ P` is *by definition* `P → false`, so you can just
start this one with `intro h` if you like. 

## Pro tip:

```
  conv begin
    to_lhs,
    rw hc,
  end,
```

is an incantation which rewrites `hc` only on the left hand side of the goal.
Look carefully at the commas. You don't need to use `conv` to solve this,
but it's a helpful trick when `rw` is rewriting too much.

/- Lemma
For all naturals $a$, $\operatorname{succ}(a)$ is not at most $a$.
-/
theorem not_succ_le_self (a : mynat) : ¬ (succ a ≤ a) :=
begin
  intro h,
  cases h with c h,
  induction a with d hd,
  { rw succ_add at h,
    exact zero_ne_succ _ h,
  },
  { rw succ_add at h,
    apply hd,
    apply succ_inj,
    exact h,
  }




end
